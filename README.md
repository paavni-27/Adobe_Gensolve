# Curve Master: Curve Regularization and Symmetry Detection

This project focused on processing and analyzing curve data by implementing multiple computational techniques such as curve regularization, symmetry detection, and curve completion. The ultimate goal was to convert raw, potentially noisy or incomplete curve data into precise, geometrically regular shapes. The final output was visualized and saved in SVG and PNG formats for further analysis.

### Steps and Approaches:

1. *Loading CSV Data:*
   - *Why:* The first step involved loading the curve data from CSV files using the read_csv function. This data represented various curves that needed to be processed.
   - *How:* The CSV files contained coordinates of curve paths, which were structured into individual curves by grouping the data based on unique identifiers within the file.

2. *Curve Regularization:*
   - *Why:* Raw curve data often contains imperfections due to various factors like noise or manual drawing inaccuracies. To analyze and visualize these curves accurately, we needed to regularize them to fit ideal geometric shapes.
   - *How:* We implemented different techniques to identify whether a curve was a straight line, circle, or polygon:
     - *Lines:* We used linear regression to fit the data points and check if they closely follow a straight line. A high R-squared value indicated a straight line, and the curve was adjusted accordingly.
     - *Circles:* For circular shapes, we checked if the points were equidistant from a central point. If so, the curve was adjusted to form a perfect circle.
     - *Polygons:* We used the convex hull algorithm to identify and regularize polygonal shapes, ensuring that the vertices formed a proper polygon.
   - *Outcome:* The curves were transformed into regularized versions, closely matching ideal geometric shapes, which enhanced the accuracy of subsequent analyses.

3. *Symmetry Detection:*
   - *Why:* Symmetry is a fundamental property in geometry and pattern recognition. Detecting symmetry in curves allowed us to further refine the shapes and ensure they were geometrically accurate.
   - *How:* 
     - We calculated the mean of the curve's points and reflected the curve across this mean line.
     - The distance between the original and reflected curves was measured. If this distance was minimal, the curve was deemed symmetric, and it was regularized to enforce this symmetry.
   - *Outcome:* Symmetric curves were adjusted to ensure perfect symmetry, which not only improved their appearance but also their analytical utility.

4. *Curve Completion:*
   - *Why:* In many practical scenarios, curves might be partially occluded or incomplete. To fully analyze these curves, we needed to reconstruct the missing parts.
   - *How:* 
     - We identified incomplete curves by checking if the distance between the first and last points was disproportionately large.
     - Using interpolation (specifically cubic interpolation), we estimated the missing points, thereby completing the curve.
   - *Outcome:* The curves that were originally incomplete were successfully completed, allowing for comprehensive analysis.

5. *Visualization and Export:*
   - *Why:* Visual representation of the processed data was crucial for validating the results and for further use in applications that require precise geometric shapes.
   - *How:* 
     - We used matplotlib to plot the processed curves, enabling a visual comparison between the original and processed versions.
     - The curves were then exported to SVG and PNG formats using the svgwrite and cairosvg libraries. This allowed the processed data to be used in various other applications or for further detailed analysis.
   - *Outcome:* The final visualizations clearly demonstrated the improvements in curve regularization, symmetry, and completion, making the curves suitable for use in any application requiring precise geometric data.

### Outcomes:

- *Enhanced Data Accuracy:* The regularization process significantly improved the accuracy of the curves, making them more suitable for subsequent analysis or practical application.
- *Symmetric Regularization:* Symmetry detection ensured that the curves adhered to geometric principles, improving both their aesthetic and analytical qualities.
- *Curve Reconstruction:* The completion algorithms successfully reconstructed incomplete curves, filling in gaps and allowing for more comprehensive data interpretation.
- *High-Quality Visualization:* The use of SVG and PNG formats for saving the curves provided high-quality, scalable outputs that can be utilized in a wide range of applications.

Overall, the project effectively transformed raw curve data into precise, regularized shapes, enhancing the quality and utility of the data for further analysis or practical application.
